            During my trip to Saudi Arabia I visited Al-Madina,  it holds a special place in my heart as the city of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The tranquility of Al-Masjid an-Nabawi and the sense of unity among visitors are indescribable. It's a place where faith and history come alive, offering a deeply spiritual experience. Visiting Al-Madina reminded me of the importance of simplicity and connection to Allah.

             Vancouver is a city that perfectly blends urban living with natural beauty. One of the highlights was walking across the Capilano Suspension Bridge, a great experience that offered stunning views of the green forest and the rushing river far below. The gentle sway of the bridge made the adventure thrilling. The surrounding park added to the charm with its towering trees and the peaceful ambiance of nature. Vancouver is a city where you can go from the beach to the mountain in the same day, making it truly unforgettable.

               Banff was a fun family trip filled with hiking, stunning views, and unforgettable moments. It’s located in the heart of the Canadian Rockies, a breathtaking destination filled with rugged mountains, crystal-clear lakes, and diverse wildlife. I love the hiking trails, and the relaxing nature. The natural beauty of the Canadian Rockies and the clear blue lakes make it a must-see. Bring a good camera and comfortable shoes as there’s so much to explore!</p>

            Austria will always be special to me; it’s where I met my partner in Vorarlberg. Austria is known for its beautiful nature, stunning cities like Vienna, Salzburg, and Vorarlberg, and its rich cultural heritage. I enjoyed the calm nature, the beautiful palaces, and traditional Austrian dishes like Wiener Schnitzel and Sachertorte.</p>
